Details on our approach to creating models for financial sustainability will be included here. This includes questions we're asking to spur conversation and how we're thinking of the problem at hand.
## Questions
### As a Property Mogul

**1. What's your budget for purchasing property? Are you looking for something more secluded or closer to a metropolitan area?**

Budget is flexible though not unlimited. We are hoping to spend around $250k USD for the land without improvements, with improvements, we'd be willing to look at property upt o $1.5M USD. Our hope is to be within 30-40 minutes of a city locale with a population of 20k - 40k+.

**2. Have you considered whether you'd like the property to already have existing structures, or are you open to developing it from scratch?**

Open to developing from scratch, though having existing structures like a living space for the first family would help establish the property 

**3. What are the zoning laws or land use constraints that you need to be aware of for the type of project you want to implement?**

You can assume that there are no zoning laws that would hinder permitting and developing multiple dwelling units on the property, use this assumption to think big and creatively as to ways we can harness natural resources, space, and creative dwelling places.

**4. Would you consider leasing land instead of purchasing it outright, and under what circumstances?**

No, we do not want to lease the land, purchasing is a primary goal.

**5. What are your thoughts on natural resources on the property like water bodies, forests, etc.?**

Having substantial natural resources is a must. We need at least minimally acceptable soil health that we can grow veggtables and raise small livestock and pultry. Minimally we want forested areas of the proeprty in order to provide variation, diversity and potential heat sources. Idealy we would find a property with natural bodies of water, small lake/pond or running streams. We will also ensure that the property is perkable for well drilling to provide adequate water supply to multiple inhabitants at a time as well as small herds of livestock (1-3 cows, 3-6 goats and around a dozen chickens / ducks at any given time)

### As a Sustainable Small-Farm Manager

**1. What is the primary agricultural focus? Livestock, crops, or a mixture of both?**

Primary goal is crops. Pultry (chickens and ducks) secondary, and Livestock teriary. And by livestock we don't image more than 3 cows or goats as noted above.

**2. What kinds of sustainable practices are you considering implementing? For example, composting, solar energy, wind energy, etc.**

We want to lean into the most favorable practices and stack as many strategies as possible that are compatible with the natural resources in our care. We want to work with the land and with the talent that we have access to in order to weild as many regenerative practices as possible for heat, food, shelter etc. I do not imagine wind energy will be a goal however composting (both food and sewage), solar and thermal harvesting will be part of the plan. 

**3. Are you planning to engage the community in farming practices, like community-supported agriculture (CSA) models or volunteer farming?**

Probably not a CSA though we would be open to the suggestion should the practice create a sustaining factor in our sustainabilty model. Volunteer farming will be a huge part of what we do, partnering through programs like WOOF and other suggested organizations will be key in networking with these groups.

**4. What kinds of products are you thinking of growing or creating that would be marketable?**

Potentially we'd be looking at edable products, both fresh and processed on site (honey, jams, etc.)

**5. How much manual labor are you expecting to require, and do you have a plan for how to source it?**

As mentioned earlier we intend to harness networks like WOOF and our own networks to connect with those that need time and space on the property as possible. The goal of the property is to bring people into a restful place where they are able to work with their hands if they are able and interested, and at the same time find healing for their mind, body, soul.

### As a Scrappy Business Entrepreneur

**1. What is the mission statement for your project? What's the key value proposition?**

Find shelter from the storm. In a busying world we have little space or time to truly know or be known. In our technological world we are quite disconnected from ourselves and from an embodied human experience. Our hope is to create powerful onramps for all types of people to come and find solice here. Our tradition is rooted in Christian mysticism and founded on Bendictine and Franciscan pillars of contemplation where God is ever present, here with us. Even so, our invitation is to all who are curious and find themselves drawn to what's happening here. We extend that welcome to all traditions and backgrounds as we hope to learn and glean from one another.

**2. How quickly are you looking to become financially self-sustaining?**

Idealy we find sustainability within 18-24 months of breaking ground.

**3. Are you considering any technological solutions that might give you a unique edge?**

Our goal is to not shun technology but use it as a tool and no more. We recognizre the cognitive devastation handheld technology has had on young and old minds alike. Part of our tenents includes building space to escape from these horrors, to find the power of solitude, friendship, love, companionship.

We will use technology though as necessary to connect, network and further our mission. We hope to use a network of sensors and in-house developed IoT devices to leverage our ability to address the needs of the crops and livestock while not introducing distraction. This is key.

**4. What is your marketing strategy for attracting people to your project initially?**

This is TBD, though we hope to develop this soon. We are also open to ideas.

**5. How open are you to partnerships or collaborations with other organizations, whether they are local businesses, non-profits, or educational institutions?**

We believe that partnerships with other organizations will be critical in pushing off from shore as we begin to navigate new waters as a team. Our hope is to bring in many guests speakers, teachers, educators to help give diverse insight into Christian spiritualality, mediation, sustainable farming and building more resiliant relationships, and more.

**6. Are you considering hosting events, workshops, or educational programs that could generate revenue?**

Absolutely, in conjunction with third-party partnerships, we imagine a primary source of revenue might be events, workshops and educational programs, retreats, short term stays, long term stays and more.

**7. What are some revenue streams you've already thought about, and how would you prioritize them?**

- Short term stays
- Produce sales
- Workshops
- Educational Programs
- *we are open to many other ideas, we'd love to have others elaborate what they see as possible streams of revenue*

**8. Do you have a target demographic? If so, what are their interests, and how do you plan to meet their needs?**

Anyone interested in participatying, we want a diver age group as we will need insight from a range of people from different backgrounds. If I had to say, I would imagine 18 being the youngest, on up into 60s+
