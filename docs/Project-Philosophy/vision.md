# Vision and Mission

In a word, restoration. 

The vision is to create a resetting place for people of all ages to gain shelter from the storm. The storm is the noise that distracts from the truth of the present. Our poor minds face an onslaught of endless distraction. The multi-trillion-dollar distraction economy has placed us squarely in its sights and the battle for the mind is in full motion with no letting up. As we are sucked into this funnel our lives begin to resemble and feel more like a zombie existence. What are we willing to forget about ourselves and about our world for the endless pleasure the distraction promises?

We ourselves are not the restorers, we are participants in a story of restoration. We simply facilitate a physical place where others can come and find their path to restoration.

The mission is quite simple. Seek truth about our world and ourselves. Create a physical place that allows for the reset and rest our minds and bodies need badly. A place for renewal, regeneration, and revival of the body, spirit and brain. Put your hand in the dirt, understand your place in nature, slow down, and engage with others.

In one sense it's very practical, and simple. Simple yet not simplistic, simple truth is often deep and profound. Simple becomes a gateway to depth that we'd otherwise pass over or ignore entirely if it weren't for curiosity. Through the Chistian tradition we acknowledge the perennial wisdom of the Christian mystics and their practices of contemplentation and meditation as we seek communion and a mutually shared spirituality based in love and service of one another and the world.

I don't believe planning every detail is necessary or even possible. In fact, why leave it to certainty? Instead, an open heart to find the potential hidden in the field in front of us.
