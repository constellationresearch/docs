# Motivations

The motives behind this project primarily align with [The Why](the%20why.md) document. While it may be more whimsical, let's aim to be more practical.

Motivations are a funny thing, your motives are why you actually intend to do X or Y. Fear is a motivator, so is hope and love. All of these play a part in the project  motivations, but my heart asks me to lean toward Hope instead of Fear, I hope to reflect that here.

Project motivations include:
- Curiosity
- The mind needs a better diet than society is offering
- The soul needs a family to grow strong
- Physical labor is good for all of us and should be part of our experience
- Communal spirituality doesn't have to be hierarchical but can be a shared mutual experience that is held in reverence as a community
- ... more to come
