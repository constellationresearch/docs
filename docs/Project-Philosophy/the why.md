# The Why

## "*To discover and decode the meaningful so that we can all be more truly human.*"

**Discover** implies a search-invoked journey to uncover something unknown

**Decode** implies a wrestling with the discovery to unlock the true message behind the metaphor

**Meaningful** points toward to the essence and core human question, why am I here and why do I exist?

**Truly** suggests that there is truth, and I am part of it and belong to it.

**Human** is to acknowledge the preciousness of our physical existence and the beauty of our physical world, and the goodness that we are partaking in by choosing to be here.
