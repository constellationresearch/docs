# Location
The location hunt is a vital aspect of the project's success. Here you'll find our process for picking location and our current progress in hopes of finding the best plot possible. 

## Characteristics
Location search is weighted and evaluated based on the following characteristics:
- Zoning and regulatory flexibility allowing for multi-dwelling units, etc.
- On site natural resources
    - Flat useable land is a must
    - Forested portions would be highly saught after
    - Bodies of water, pond, lake, streams of high value
    - Well water viability is a requirement
- Soil health and safety
- Local environmental concerns (ie try not to be next to a nuclear powerplant)
- Proximity to town / cities with easy access airport, goods and services
- Cost (land, building, cost of living)
- Climate and annual weather patterns both present and future considerations
- Population density
- Cultural considerations
- Local and state government concerns
- Proprty Taxes and state regulatory considerations


## States and Regions

- NC
- VA
- WV
- MD
- NH
- VT
- ME

Edge cases: 
- WY

## Cities
Currently we've put a few cities on our list to scour and put under further consideration.

Certainly, here's a comprehensive listing that includes the previously provided information along with new insights on why each city aligns well with the project's goals. This format should be easy for you to copy-paste into your project documentation:


:::tip How cost of living is calculated
The Cost of Living index provided for each city is a relative measure that compares the expense of basic goods and services—including housing, groceries, utilities, transportation, and healthcare—in that area to the U.S. average, which is set at 100. If a city has a Cost of Living index of 110, it means that it is 10% more expensive to live there compared to the national average. Conversely, an index of 90 would mean it is 10% cheaper.

The indices are drawn from various public databases and online resources that compile economic data, though it's important to note that these are approximate values and can fluctuate over time due to various economic factors. They serve as a generalized guide to understand the economic landscape of a given area.
